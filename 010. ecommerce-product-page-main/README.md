### Useful resources

- [img SVG filter](https://codepen.io/sosuke/pen/Pjoqqp) - Again this CodePen helped me to change the SVG color within an image. Really useful.
- [Image Carousel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HcxHDS2w1s&ab_channel=WebDevSimplified) - This is an amazing article which helped me to make the product carousel slider. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
